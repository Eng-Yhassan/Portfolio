            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Software Developer | Mogadishu, Somalia</h1>
            <p>Hello! I’m Yahye Hassan, a passionate Full
                Stack Web Developer and Graphic Designer.
                I bring a unique blend of skills that allows
                me to create modern, functional, and visually
                appealing websites, as well as engaging designs
                that stand out.</p>
            <p>I specialize in the MERN Stack, which enables me
                to build complete web applications with responsive
                front-ends and stable back-ends. On the design side,
                I use Adobe Illustrator and other creative tools to
                craft graphics, logos, and visual content that help
                brands make an impact.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that technology is a tool to transform
                creative ideas into reality. My goal is to help individuals
                and businesses achieve their objectives through well-designed
                websites, eye-catching designs, and reliable digital solutions.</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Beyond the Code:</h1>
            <p>When I’m not building websites, I’m creating digital tips,
                exploring design trends, and connecting with like-minded
                creators on social media. Drop by my profiles or say hi—I’d
                love to connect!</p>
