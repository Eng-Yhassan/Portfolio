# My portfolio website 

Software Developer | Mogadishu, Somalia
Hello! I’m Yahye Hassan, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and Graphic Designer. I bring a unique blend of skills that allows me to create modern, functional, and visually appealing websites, as well as engaging designs that stand out.

I specialize in the MERN Stack, which enables me to build complete web applications with responsive front-ends and stable back-ends. On the design side, I use Adobe Illustrator and other creative tools to craft graphics, logos, and visual content that help brands make an impact.

I firmly believe that technology is a tool to transform creative ideas into reality. My goal is to help individuals and businesses achieve their objectives through well-designed websites, eye-catching designs, and reliable digital solutions.

Beyond the Code:
When I’m not building websites, I’m creating digital tips, exploring design trends, and connecting with like-minded creators on social media. Drop by my profiles or say hi—I’d love to connect!
